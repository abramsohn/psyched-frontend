# Project #4: Psyched

## Overview

Psyched is a fullstack app that helps Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) clients to practice skills for managing emotions. While clients acquire skills in groups, the app helps to support skill practice and generalization.

Psyched also allows therapists to track clients' implementation of the skills, and monitor their progress.
